## Overview

For this final group project, we created an app called NearHere that allows a user to input an address/location/landmark anywhere in the world. They can then enter interests (such as food cuisines, shopping desires, parks, etc.) and receive a single map that shows places which are close by to their chosen location. Users can add/remove favorite locations and save them to their profiles in order to view them on a map later. We also built a companion mobile app which allows users to access their saved favorites for viewing while "on-the-go". This mobile app has been launched in "development mode" to the Google Play Store, while the web app has been deployed on Heroku.
